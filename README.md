# Problem2
 Demonstrate the suspension system for one wheel of an old-fashioned pickup truck.The mass of the vehicle is m1 and the mass ofthe wheel is m2. The suspension spring has a spring constant k1 and the tire had thespring constant k2. The damping constant of the shock absorber is b. Obtain the mathematical model which represent the vehicle response to bump in the road and simulate it for 100 sec. Create a dummy input signal to represent the bumpy road using MATLAB program.
 
 Note: First simulate the model suspensionsystem.slx and then run the matlab script init.m to observe the output plots.
